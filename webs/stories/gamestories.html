                                Mark Watts was an extraordinarily smart adult. When he was a kid, he accomplished all
                                his school workbooks in one day, getting over 90% correct. As an adult, he was a famous
                                billionaire with a giant mansion overly automated.<br><br>
                                One day, Mark made a life game. It required ten whole years with one hundred
                                programmers, including himself, to build. It was also so finely built that he could
                                simulate consciousness and a life with it. Things could be automatically generated as
                                people built new things, from a dirt hill to a giant galaxy civilization.<br><br>
                                Mark was almost finished with the wires which were able to connect all the computers and
                                the game to a giant screen for him to play on. Suddenly, he heard someone shouting, “The
                                code is complete, and the test run is running – the results are excellent! The game must
                                be complete!” Mark plugged all the wires in faster and he felt his heart beating faster.
                                After all the wires were plugged in, he started the game.<br><br>
                                Mark watched the game loading, but something else happened. An odd mysterious glow
                                appeared around the screen. Suddenly, the game finished loading and the glow was
                                stronger than ever. Then, a man came in, who startled Mark. Mark fell onto the screen,
                                which suddenly turned into a portal.<br><br>
                                Mark felt that he was falling and falling, endlessly in light. There was a burning and
                                pressurizing sensation. Then, he landed with a thump on a rock. He stood up with all his
                                strength. He recognized this place: a large field with grass all over, except the rock
                                that he landed on. He knew he had magically gone into his own game. He looked up at the
                                sky, as he felt like falling into this game. There was nothing, not a speck of
                                dust.<br><br>
                                Just then, a man came up to him. Mark felt as if the man appeared out of nowhere. He
                                knew he would have to adjust to his game for a long time, maybe even forever. The man
                                gave him a bag with some food and drinks. Then, he walked away. Mark walked towards a
                                pillar of smoke that just appeared. He had decided on his goal, which was to at least
                                get a stable life there.<br><br>
                                After Mark walked for some time, he saw a village. Smoke was billowing from the chimney
                                of a house. He knocked on the door. A woman dressed in blue led him in. She asked him
                                what the problem was and told him she was the mayoress of the village. Mark easily
                                convinced her to listen to him by telling her he was smarter than them and told her
                                about her deepest and darkest secrets.<br><br>
                                Mark programmed this lady, so he knew he was right. This persuasion gave him a village
                                to control and permanent shelter and food. This was a nice milestone for such a long
                                journey that he did not even know about.<br><br>
                                Mark Watts talked to the mayoress about political issues. The mayoress also said her
                                name was Kate Kingston. Kate mentioned other villages competing and she had a strong
                                village army. She also mentioned about wanting to retire but her citizens protesting.
                                Mark took the chance and said he would be happy to take over. Kate agreed
                                immediately.<br><br>
                                Mark commanded the soldiers to attack every piece of land they could find. The soldiers
                                marched towards the nearest village. The villagers were so scared that they immediately
                                surrendered without any fighting. The other villages got the same fate. After roads were
                                paved and a castle was built, Mark was officially the king. He owned a giant kingdom and
                                a strong army now.<br><br>
                                After taking care of some matters, Mark found a letter out of nowhere. It said,
                                “Congratulations, you earned all the starter achievements! Time to play the game more
                                seriously!” Mark almost forgot that he was trapped in this world for now, but the letter
                                reminded him of that. It also reminded him that a bonus should appear. Then, suddenly,
                                hundreds of soldiers appeared out of nowhere.<br><br>
                                Mark almost fainted. He did not program this part and he did not think it would happen
                                that way. He immediately ordered all of them to attack the neighboring kingdom. Sadly,
                                Mark was only able to take a small patch of land as the kingdom was stronger than
                                expected. Now Mark had conquered the whole of India, Nepal, and China.<br><br>
                                Mark found some gunpowder mines in Nepal and invented the gun and bombs. He taught
                                soldiers and blacksmiths how to make and use them. He was then much stronger and
                                defeated every country in Asia while using boats to conquer all the islands. His kingdom
                                quickly grew to an empire.<br><br>
                                Mark told his enormous army to attack countries one-by-one if possible. They marched
                                towards Europe and started firing guns and cannons at the opposing army. Mark sat on a
                                gold-diamond throne at the time. He ordered inventors all over Asia and conquered
                                islands to come together and invent new weapons and tools.<br><br>
                                Mark heard the news that countries in Europe, Africa, and Australia were all conquered.
                                He knew there was also North and South America, so he told his army to set sail around
                                the world to find new islands and continents. His inventors now invented so much that
                                the world was being fast forward. Time in the game was going faster, while Mark just had
                                to sleep, and a year passes by.<br><br>
                                When Mark woke up, he found himself ruling over a modern world, with all the famous
                                scientists there. He was so excited. He always wanted to live in Antarctica, so why not
                                do so? Mark was then the ruler of Earth. He could do anything he wanted. How about
                                walking on the Moon? He decided he wanted to control the Solar System with
                                rockets.<br><br>
                                Mark ordered NASA to immediately start a Moon base program. Mark had a lot of money, and
                                he certainly did not want a rebellion, so he paid money for the program. He also paid
                                five hundred Gamian dollars to every citizen as a good measure. Mark was surely a smart
                                man – he went from a mayor to an Earth ruling emperor!<br><br>
                                <div style="text-align: center;">***</div>
                                Here, it was a dark and wet place. A place far away from the centre of Mark’s empire. A
                                figure stepped out of the darkness and boomed, “Start the meeting!” Then, more hooded
                                people came out. They started discussing how they would destroy everything.<br><br>
                                NASA came back to Mark after a few months. They had a report on the moon base formation.
                                Mark read the report, which said, “The Moon Base Program: Currently, the agriculture
                                project has started. A flag from an unknown organization has been found. Also, an
                                abandoned moon base with the same flag was found. A document inside said that they were
                                The Dark Omega.<br><br>
                                Mark was shocked. He forgot about the villains he made! He remembered that The Dark
                                Omega was an organization that wanted to take over the world. Mark realized that meant
                                their first step was to destroy him and take over the throne of this planetary empire.
                                They would probably steal the Moon to first prevent him from reaching out.<br><br>
                                Mark ordered the base to be accomplished faster, and a spacecraft made to carry him to
                                the base when it was done. A few months later, he was in a capsule with food for the
                                long journey. After the spacecraft landed, Mark ordered the rest of the people to come
                                out: soldiers and weapon makers. Firearms, bombs, and even two thermonuclear bombs were
                                carried out.<br><br>
                                Mark was not surprised that another army was waiting for them. He commanded NASA to
                                start a Mars program while they were dealing with this. The opposing army shouted, “We
                                will challenge you on the Moon! ATTACK!” While Mark was going to the Moon, he still
                                needed to face another army.<br><br>
                                Mark was ready for war. He had known The Dark Omega would never give up a tiny fight.
                                Although Mark was holding the opposing army well, they were still losing.<br><br>
                                The presence of Mark on the battlefield was a rare sight, but he was holding a laser
                                which used 1000 volts per second. Mark’s men carried a giant battery while Mark aimed
                                for the healing and resting centre of the enemy. The lasers inside were focused into a
                                shrinking glass which blasted a beam of light.<br><br>
                                The target wire was vaporized immediately, and the wall behind it melted into a pool of
                                goo. Another laser beam caused an energy tank to explode, killing half of the opposing
                                army. All other weapons in storage were also vaporized. Mark was winning. While his
                                soldiers were wiping out all traces of battle and the enemy army, another rocket
                                came.<br><br>
                                The soldiers were horrified, whereas Mark was delighted. Suddenly, the door opened. A
                                NASA astronaut announced, “King Mark, your palace on Mars is complete, we are now the
                                first in this game to be interplanetary!” The game was designed so there would be
                                multiple solar systems to live in, each with the same planets though.<br><br>
                                Mark was delighted. He asked for a list of current players. The list read, “NO OTHER
                                PLAYERS; MARK IS THE FIRST AND CREATOR” Mark was suddenly very depressed. If there were
                                other players, he could get a chance to tell the outside world where he was.<br><br>
                                Mark still stepped into the rocket and pressed a red TAKEOFF button. The rocket blasted
                                off the moon, ready for a two-month journey to Mars. He was excited but at the same time
                                scared. The Dark Omega was supposed to be already there.<br><br>
