                Mr. Fish was an expert at catching fish. One day, he decided to catch fish from the sea. He went to a
                nearby beach. Then, he took his fish rod and bait with him and steered a rented fishing boat out to the
                sea.
                <br><br>Mr. Fish had heard of the sea serpent, which was later said to be an oarfish. He wanted to catch
                the extremely rare oarfish before anyone else could find it. He wanted to be famous for catching the
                oarfish. Suddenly he saw a stream of bubble and strong ripples in the water nearby.
                <br><br>Mr. Fish carefully dropped the fishing reel with the bait near that spot and waited patiently.
                He suddenly saw the ball on the fish reel go down. He immediately pulled the rod frantically to reel the
                fish in. He saw that the fish was huge, heavy, and silvery! He heaped the oarfish on board and kept it
                in a giant fish tank.
                <br><br>Mr. Fish was so excited that he jumped up and down. Then he went back to the shore to show
                people his amazing “feat”. He donated the large fish to a museum owned by his friend. He decided to
                catch more fish after he caught the oarfish. He had accomplished many fishing feats and what excitement
                will happen in the next episode: The Living Fossil?

                Mr. Fish had accomplished many fishing feats, including catching the Oarfish. This time, he went for a
                walk to the pier to fish. He hoped to have a big discovery or catch. He prepared the rod and cast the
                line extremely far and let the bait sink.
                <br><br>Mr. Fish wanted to catch some deep-sea fish because undiscovered fish were mostly found there.
                Suddenly, the line was tugged by a fish. He tried to reel the fish in, but it was too strong. He pulled
                and pulled. Finally, he caught this blue grey fish, after about 20 minutes of pulling.
                <br><br>Mr. Fish brought the fish, which was in a big tank now, to his friend, who knew a lot about
                fish. He said that it was a Coelacanth(see-luh-can-th), a fish believed to be extinct 80 million years
                ago! Mr. Fish was so surprized that he almost dropped the Coelacanth.
                <br><br>Mr. Fish donated the Coelacanth to the same museum that he donated the Oarfish. Then, he held a
                Coelacanth themed party at home. That day, Mr. Fish accomplished a fossil feat. What fate will accompany
                him in the next episode: The Great White Shark? Read on to find out.

                Mr. Fish was good at fishing and was known for various fishing feats. Although he had caught rare and
                cool fish, he had never caught a shark. One day, he decided to catch one. He took a boat out to the sea
                to fish for sharks.
                <br><br>After casting and waiting, Mr. Fish could only catch some bass and snapper. He decided to use
                larger bait. He attached a sea bass to the hook and dropped it into the water. He saw a shadow near.
                Suddenly, a shark emerged and ate the bass.
                <br><br>Mr. Fish pulled and pulled. Finally, the shark seemed to give up swimming away. He threw a net
                that happened to be on the boat to catch the shark. When he pulled it up, he was shocked to see that the
                shark was a great white shark.
                <br><br>After Mr. Fish took some photos, he released the shark to the sea to protect the marine
                environment. That was because great white sharks could not be kept in the museums. He was so excited. He
                exclaimed in excitement, “I will catch a sawfish next week!” He was right. What excitement will emerge
                in the next episode: The Sawed Fish (The Sawfish)? Read on to find out.

                <br><br>Steering the boat out to the big blue sea, Mr. Fish looked for a spot where he might find

                touching it. Then, he was shocked to see a sawfish bite on the bait.
                <br><br>After pulling the rod for quite a while, Mr. Fish felt the sawfish trying to cut the rope. He
                was worried that the sawfish would escape. Then, the sawfish stopped swimming. He immediately took the

                  Fish are animals, like us, so they need to eat. Various fish eat a variety of food, including
                  plankton, tiny fish, crustaceans, parasites, insects, medium sized fish, and many more.
                  <br><br>To digest food, fish also have a digestive system. They have about the same system as people.
                  Because fish constantly need oxygen too, they developed lungs and gills. Fish keep their mouths open
                  to allow water to pass though their mouths.
                  <br><br>The gills do not need to move. The water just goes though the mouth and the water is either
                  filtered by the gills for oxygen and released or filtered by gills and absorbed by the fish.
                  <br><br>Fish also need to excrete the waste piled up in the digestive tracts. They eject though the
                  anus (located near the stomach). Fish, like us, also have a urinary bladder. It works similarly to the
                  anus.
                  <br><br>To swim around, fish also have a set of fins. Those fins only help the fish speed up a bit and
                  control direction. It is the tail that helps fish swim. It is like a muscle that pushes the fish
                  forward. Our legs are not evolved from a tail, though.
                  <br><br>To have offsprings, fish need a reproductive system. The male have sperms while the female get
                  eggs. Some fish bear the babies like the humans, which means having a baby growing in the mother fish
                  and getting “born”. Most fish have eggs instead.
                  <br><br>Some fish change gender after they grow to a certain size or age. These fish go through the
                  change naturally, not by DNA. One example is a species called Wrasse.
                  <br><br>After learning a lot about the fish, please rate this add-on learning-episode. If you like
                  this, do not hesitate to read the next part: The Science of Fish (Part 2)!

                  Fish possess different organs to detect predators and prey. Eyes are the most known, although some
                  fish still do not have eyes. The eyes work similarly to terrestrial vertebrates but are rounder in
                  shape. Some fish can even detect polarized or UV light.
                  <br><br>Although it may not seem like it, most fish have nostrils like humans. The nostrils work by
                  detecting chemicals in the water, which is like human’s nose, which detects chemical in the air.
                  <br><br>Some fish have a special organ – the electric organ. This organ is a biochemical “battery”. It
                  can be used for a variety of ways. With weak voltage, it can detect prey and predators, whereas with
                  strong voltages, it can stun or kill prey and scare predators.
                  <br><br>Those fish which are hunted by the fish with electrical organs need to know when such a
                  predator is nearby, so that they can evolve organs to detect those electrical pulses.
                  <br><br>To detect food and predators effectively, fish have evolved a lateral line, which is a line
                  with sense organs and cells located on it. It is usually recognizable from a break in colour.
                  <br><br>A fish needs to control these organs. To do that, it requires a brain. The brain of fish is
                  small in ratio compared to other similarly sized birds or mammals, but it makes sense because they are
                  less evolved in comparison.
                  <br><br>Evolution has allowed some fish to evolve with a larger brain and even to human size. The
                  Coelacanth or other lobe finned fish probably evolved to land animals.
                  <br><br>If this episode is interesting, never forget to read the next Mr. Fish story “The Giant
                  Catch”.

                  After catching the saw fish, Mr. Fish decided to retire from adventurous fishing, but continued normal
                  fishing. Today was a lucky day of fishing.
                  <br><br>Steering his boat to the big blue sea, Mr. Fish felt a cool breeze blowing. “A nice day for
                  fishing,” he muttered to himself. He dropped the hook with the bait attached into the water. He saw a
                  giant shadow moving slowly and silently in the water towards the bait.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish knew this fish was slow-to-bite. He waited as patient as a shark, ready to grab its
                  prey. He discovered a triangular fin moving by, signalling a shark. Suddenly, a wave that shook the
                  boat violently came – it was a big bite.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish immediately reeled the fish in. It was too strong. Snap! The was broken. Red with
                  anger, he tried again with his best rod: Strong Liner 5000. Using the same bait, he quickly got the
                  bite again. The fishing rod, being the best automatic model, pulled the line automatically.
                  <br><br>Even with an advanced fishing rod, Mr. Fish still could not reel the fish in easily. Two hours
                  had passed, but neither side has won. Then, the fish gave a wrong turn. Mr. Fish now had the best
                  position. With a lot of effort, he reeled the fish in.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish used a fishing robot to pull the fish out of the water. “No, it couldn’t be. It is a
                  fishing legend!” he exclaimed, for now he caught a whale shark, which was the largest fish species in
                  the world. Mr. Fish almost fainted.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish bought the gigantic fish to his friend working at the museum. He further proved that
                  it was indeed a whale shark. Mr. Fish donated the fish to the museum, as usual. All museum staff were
                  excited.

                  Mr. Fish had lot of fishing experiences, but he had retired into adventurous fishing only. Today he
                  got a heavy fishing rod hook and prepared for a great fishing trip.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish drove his old companion, his boat, to the sea. After lunch, he seemed to have found a
                  good spot. He dropped the hook and bait into the water, and watched it sink. He held the rod patiently
                  and tightly.
                  <br><br>A movement was felt by Mr. Fish. He thought the fish was just checking. He reeled the line
                  slowly in. He stopped after a few turns. A few waves splashed the side of the boat. Then the string
                  was pulled.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish reeled it in, making him tired. He could see the fish. Mr. Fish was scared to death
                  by the mere look of it. Giant teeth with a long and slender body, it was the Viperfish. He caught it
                  and took it to the boat.
                  <br><br>The fish suddenly bit the string. Mr. Fish got a net immediately. After attempting to pin the
                  fish to the ground, he got a deep gash on the arm. Then, the fish bounced itself upward and jumped
                  back to the ocean.
                  <br><br>It was a big loss! This loss to Mr. Fish only made him more determined to catch fish. Read the

                  After catching the Viperfish which escaped, Mr Fish was angry. He wanted to catch a fish to take
                  revenge on the escaped Viperfish. He decided to take action in the deep sea.
                  <br><br>In his new adventure, Mr. Fish added a 60kg weight to the bait. It was so heavy so it was
                  impossible for Mr Fish to throw the bait. He drove his boat out to the sea once again and dropped the
                  bait where he knew it would reach the midnight zone.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish felt a slight tug but did not pull the bait back yet. The tug then became a pull. Mr.
                  Fish knew it was time to reel it in. He felt that this fish must be light, as the bait was going up as
                  if the fish was not there!
                  <br><br>After Mr. Fish reeled in the fish, he was shocked. He had never missed a fish before. The line
                  was dangling there in the air. There was a Viperfish fang sticking out of the weight. Mr. Fish went as
                  angry as a charging bull. He punched the boat only to get hurt.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish angrily steered the boat back to land, as he forgot to bring extra hooks. He decided
                  he would stop fishing in the sea for some time. Instead, he would fish in freshwater. He knew
                  freshwater fish will not be too big, so he prepared only small hooks this time.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish went to a nearby river and threw the bait. He felt a slight tug, which alerted him
                  that a fish was nearby. He felt a stronger tug, only to see nothing apart from the hook when he reeled
                  in the hook. Therefore, he was furious. He jabbed a bait that he knew must attract fish on the hook.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish felt a fish bite and reeled the hook back in. He saw a common bluegill. He knew that
                  sometimes the good would come after the bad so he persevered. This time, he got something rare – a two
                  headed mutant Neon Tetra.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish mailed the specimen to the museum that he donated his other fish. He was so proud of
                  being able to contribute to the collection at the museum. He continued fishing again. After throwing
                  the bait, a fish already bit the hook. He reeled the fish in and saw that it was a Betta.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish decided it would be a perfect pet as the Betta was colourful and small. He liked it a
                  lot. He brought a fish tank for it and fed it with some fish food. Now Mr. Fish finally had a pet. He
                  could hardly stop wondering what would happen next. Read “The Shocking Catch” to find out.

                  Mr. Fish, after catching the rare neon tetra and betta, thought that the freshwater could also be a
                  fishy wonder. In his new adventure, he went to a lake called Lake Catfish and wanted to catch a rare
                  fish.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish threw the bait and hook into the middle of the lake. Mr. Fish waited patiently.
                  Suddenly, a fish bit the bait on the hook. Mr. Fish felt a shock and fainted. When Mr. Fish woke up,
                  he was sad. He missed a rare catch and his hands were numb for some reasons. He decided to go back to
                  the sea because freshwater could also be dangerous.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish drove his boat to the sea the next day. He threw the bait and waited patiently again.
                  Then a bite was felt. Mr. Fish reeled in the fishing line as fast as possible but saw only an eel.
                  Then everything went black. When he woke up again, he saw the eel swimming in a tank. He realized why
                  he fainted. It was due to electricity.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish took the eel out but was struck again by a 300-volt shock. The eel twisted its body
                  and bounced back into the sea. He felt like every fish in the ocean ceased to like him and were
                  escaping from him. He was angrier than ever. He threw the bait and hook into the ocean.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish felt a strong pull so he reeled the fish in. Luckily he was finally able to reel an
                  electric eel in without being electrified. Mr. Fish was so happy that he finally caught an electric
                  eel. He donated the eel to the museum that he donated other fish. Due to a whole lot of fish exhibits,
                  the museum was renamed The Fish Museum.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish had a good catch, so he decided to turn to the museum. He decided to retire for one
                  day in the museum and continue his journey on fishing. Read The Fish Museum to find out more!

                  Mr. Fish was taking a break from fishing to spend a day off in the Fish Museum. He had donated a lot
                  of fish to the museum. He was so happy to be able to see them again.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish walked to the ticket counter. The man asked him where his ticket was or if he needed
                  one. Mr. Fish politely remarked he was Mr. Fish and was a VIP member. The man called a lady to check
                  his VIP ticket while giving Mr. Fish a map of the museum.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish went to section A first, where fish of the reefs were shown. He saw a large butterfly
                  fish swimming by, and he immediately knew that he caught it, for the size was rare. A clownfish saw
                  the butterfly fish and somewhat started chasing it. He did not remember catching a small clownfish, so
                  he knew that it belonged to someone else.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish got to section B, where other ocean fish were on display. He saw his Coelacanth
                  sleeping on a rock. A Whale Shark was scaring away some fish from it. Some schools of Cods that he
                  caught were also there. He also saw a Great White Shark that was horribly familiar to him, but he
                  could not remember where he saw it before.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish knew that time was short, and he needed to finish fast before the museum closed. He
                  ran to section C to see his Oarfish swimming playfully while his Barreleye giving some tourists
                  nightmares. He saw an angler fish biting at a chunk of food. Mr. Fish heard an announcement. “The fish
                  museum will close in five minutes.” Mr. Fish rushed to the counter and took all his belongings back
                  with him. He walked outside and greeted the sea again. He knew he would fish again tomorrow.
                  <br><br>What would Mr. Fish reel in tomorrow? Mr. Fish would use new tricks and technology in the next
                  episode: The Dangerous Stinger.

                  Mr. Fish enjoyed a day off in the Fish Museum. He was then back at the sea filled with energy. He
                  dropped the bait in the clear water close to a coral reef. He wished to catch some manta rays or
                  better.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish saw a large shadow in the water nearby the hook, and he thought it looked like a ray.
                  It had a rhombus shape and a thin tail whipping the water around it. He felt a bite. He tried to reel
                  the fish in, but the fish somehow cut the line and escaped back into the reef.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish thought the failure was too much for him. He brought an electricity generator and
                  turned it on. He put the generator in a net and took the net to the reef again. The ray came back and
                  swam into the net. Mr. Fish pushed the button, but the ray was not electrified.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish was shocked. The stingray cut the wire. He was so angry he got a gun and shot at the
                  ray. Out of pure luck, the bullet hit a spine of the ray and shattered. Mr. Fish wished he could die.
                  His luck was so horrible. He tried using a wire net this time and finally succeeded.
                  <br><br>Mr. Fish pulled the ray out and immediately noticed he caught a toxic stingray. He put the
                  stingray on the ground and pinned it to the ground with a net. He donated the stingray to the Fish
                  Museum. What would happen in the next episode “The Sharp Revenge”? Read on to find out. (ENDS HERE)
